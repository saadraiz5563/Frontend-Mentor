# Recipe Page Challenge

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-challenge) using HTML and CSS. The challenge involved building a structured and responsive recipe page that clearly displays recipe details, ingredients, instructions, and nutrition facts.

## Overview

The project showcases a simple, yet well-organized recipe page with the following sections:
- **Recipe Details:** Displays preparation time details.
- **Ingredients:** Lists all necessary ingredients.
- **Instructions:** Provides step-by-step cooking directions.
- **Nutrition:** Presents nutritional values in a table.

The design is fully responsive and leverages semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and ease of maintenance.
