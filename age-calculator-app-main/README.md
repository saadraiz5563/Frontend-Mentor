---

## Description

A responsive, modern age calculator app that computes your age in years, months, and days based on a user-provided date. The application features robust input validation, ensuring that empty fields, out-of-range values, or invalid dates (e.g., April 31st) are handled gracefully. The UI includes smooth animations for number transitions and adheres closely to the provided design guidelines.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Seamless layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Real-Time Calculation:** Automatically computes and displays the age in years, months, and days once a valid date is entered.
- **Input Validation:** Checks for empty fields, correct day (1–31), month (1–12), and ensures the date isn’t in the future or inherently invalid.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes hover and focus states for interactive elements, plus animated transitions for the age numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for semantic structure.
- **CSS** (with Flexbox and Grid) for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** (ES6+) for dynamic calculations and validations.
